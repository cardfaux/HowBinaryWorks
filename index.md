# 0's and 1's is the only language a computer knows how to speak, so every input must get to that point.

# counting with fingers is none as uno-notation.

# deciamls 0-9 dec means 10.

# 123 3 is in the 1's place, 2 is in the 10's place, 1 is in the 100's place.. making one hundred and twenty three.

# 100 \* 1 + 10 x 2 + 1 x 3 = 100 + 20 + 3

# 10 to the 2 power 10 to the 1 power 10 to the 0 power..

# in binary we have only 2 digits so it becomes

# 2 to the 2 power, 2 to the 1 power and 2 to the 0 power

# making the left column 4 the middle column 2 and the right column 1

# 4 2 1

# 001 is 1

# 010 is 2

# 100 is 4

# 011 is 3

# 101 is 5

# 111 is 7

# bit = binary digit.

# byte = 8 bits.

# bit bit bit bit bit bit bit bit = byte

# 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1

# number 50 = 32 16 2

# number 13 = 8 4 1

- a transistor is a single switch computers have millions of these switches controlling these values.\*

# capital letter A = 65 which is 64 1 in bits.

# 01000001 = A

# A=65 B=66 C=67 D=68 E=69 F=70 G=71 H=72 I=73 .... ASCII

# 72 73 33 = HI!

# UNICODE is like a super set of ASCI. emojis use UNICODE not ASCI

# ASCII used 8 bits.

# UNICODE uses 8 or 16 or 24 or 32 ect....

# 128514 is decimals of emojis. = 11111011000000010

# RGB is the color system a computer uses to color pexels

# rgb 72 73 33 = shade of yello
